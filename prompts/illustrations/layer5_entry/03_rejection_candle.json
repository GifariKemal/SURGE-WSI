  "prompt": "Create a detailed illustration of rejection candle patterns. Split into two sections: Left side shows 'Bullish Rejection' - a candle with long lower wick (>50% of range) touching a support zone, small body at top, labeled with measurements '30% Body', '70% Wick'. Right side shows 'Bearish Rejection' - candle with long upper wick touching resistance, small body at bottom. Include formula: 'Wick Ratio = Wick Length / Total Range > 50%'. Show POI zone behind each candle. Add checkmark for valid rejection, X for invalid (small wick). Include entry trigger arrow. Color code: green body for bullish, red for bearish, zones in semi-transparent blue. Dark background (#0F172A). Educational diagram style.",
