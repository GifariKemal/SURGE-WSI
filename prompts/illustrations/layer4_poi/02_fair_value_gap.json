Highlight the FVG: The gap between the high of candle 1 and low of candle 3 (where candle 2's body doesn't overlap). Mark the gap zone with a distinctive rectangle in orange (#F97316 at 30% opacity). Label: 'Fair Value Gap', 'Candle 1 High', 'Candle 3 Low', 'Imbalance Zone'. Show price potentially returning to fill the gap. Add 'FVG' badge on the zone. Include zoomed inset showing the three-candle pattern clearly. Dark background (#0F172A). Green/red candlesticks. Professional charting style with clean annotations.",
