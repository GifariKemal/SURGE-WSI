Mark Swing Highs with downward triangles in red (#EF4444) at peak points, Swing Lows with upward triangles in green (#10B981) at trough points. Connect swing points with a zigzag line in cyan (#06B6D4). Label key swings: 'HH' (Higher High), 'HL' (Higher Low), 'LH' (Lower High), 'LL' (Lower Low). Show market structure clearly - either uptrend (HH, HL pattern) or downtrend (LH, LL pattern). Include swing lookback period indicator '[5 candles]'. Dark background (#0F172A).
