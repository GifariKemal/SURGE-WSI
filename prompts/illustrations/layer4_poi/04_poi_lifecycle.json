Five stages flowing left to right: Stage 1 'DETECTION' (magnifying glass icon, blue #3B82F6) - 'OB/FVG identified on chart'. Stage 2 'VALIDATION' (checkmark icon, purple #8B5CF6) - 'Quality score calculated'. Stage 3 'ACTIVE' (target icon, green #10B981) - 'Waiting for price to reach zone'. Stage 4 'TRIGGERED' (bell icon, orange #F59E0B) - 'Entry signal confirmed'. Stage 5 'MITIGATED' (crossed-out icon, gray #6B7280) - 'Zone used or invalidated'. Connect stages with arrows. Show branching at Stage 4: 'Trade Executed' or 'Zone Expired'. Add quality score badge (e.g., '85/100') at Stage 2. Dark background (#1E293B). Modern process flow style.",
