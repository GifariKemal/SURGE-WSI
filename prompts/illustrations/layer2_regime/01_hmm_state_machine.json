Three large circles arranged in a triangle: Top circle is green (#10B981) labeled 'BULLISH' with upward arrow icon, Bottom-left circle is red (#EF4444) labeled 'BEARISH' with downward arrow icon, Bottom-right circle is gray (#6B7280) labeled 'SIDEWAYS' with horizontal arrows icon. Curved arrows connecting all states showing transition probabilities (e.g., '0.7', '0.2', '0.1'). Self-loop arrows on each state for staying in same state. Include legend showing 'High Probability' (thick arrow) vs 'Low Probability' (thin arrow). Dark background (#0F172A) with glowing state circles. Label at top: 'Market Regime State Machine'.
