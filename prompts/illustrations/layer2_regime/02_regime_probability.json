Top section: Stacked area chart over time showing three probability bands - green area for 'P(Bullish)', red area for 'P(Bearish)', gray area for 'P(Sideways)' - all summing to 100%. Middle section: Current regime indicator showing dominant state with large icon and percentage (e.g., 'BULLISH 73%'). Bottom section: Three horizontal progress bars showing individual probabilities with percentage labels. Include x-axis labeled 'Time' and y-axis labeled 'Probability'. Use gradient fills for areas. Dark slate background (#1E293B). Add threshold line at 60% marked 'Confidence Threshold'. Modern dashboard style.",
