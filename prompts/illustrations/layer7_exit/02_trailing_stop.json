  "prompt": "Create a trading chart illustrating trailing stop mechanism. Show 15-20 candlesticks in an uptrend with price making higher highs. Display trailing stop line (red dashed) that follows price upward, always staying a fixed distance below. Mark key points: 'Initial SL' at entry, 'Trail Activated' when TP1 hit, multiple 'SL Adjusted' points as price rises. Show the trailing distance (e.g., '20 pips' or 'Previous swing low'). Final point shows 'Position Closed' where price reverses to hit the trailed stop. Include profit lock indicator showing increasing locked profit. Side diagram showing trailing stop algorithm: 'IF new_high > prev_high THEN adjust_sl'. Dark background (#0F172A). Clear trading mechanics illustration.",
