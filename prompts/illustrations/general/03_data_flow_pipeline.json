From left to right: MT5 Platform icon (trading terminal) connects via arrow to TimescaleDB cylinder (time-series database), then to Redis icon (cache layer with lightning bolt), then to Kalman Filter box (mathematical filter with wave smoothing visual), finally outputting to 'Clean Data' endpoint. Each component should be in a rounded rectangle with its name below. Use flowing animated-style dotted lines between components suggesting data movement. Dark background (#0F172A) with blue (#3B82F6) primary elements and cyan (#06B6D4) connection lines. Add small data packet icons moving along the arrows. Include labels: 'Raw Ticks', 'Historical Data', 'Hot Data', 'Smoothed Price'.",
