  "prompt": "Create a comprehensive decision tree flowchart for algorithmic trading workflow. Start with 'Market Open' diamond, branch to 'Kill Zone Active?' decision (Yes/No paths). Yes path leads to 'Check Regime' (Bullish/Bearish/Sideways branches). Bullish/Bearish paths lead to 'Find POI' then 'Entry Trigger?' decision. If trigger confirmed, flow to 'Calculate Risk' then 'Execute Trade' then 'Monitor Exit'. Include loop back arrows for continuous monitoring. Use color coding: green for bullish path, red for bearish, gray for skip/sideways. Decision diamonds in yellow (#FBBF24), process rectangles in blue (#3B82F6), start/end ovals in emerald (#10B981). Dark background (#1E293B) with white connection lines. Professional flowchart style.",
