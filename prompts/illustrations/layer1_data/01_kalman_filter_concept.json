  "prompt": "Create an educational infographic showing Kalman Filter noise reduction for financial data. Split view: Left side shows a noisy, jagged blue line representing raw price data with label 'Raw Price (Noisy)'. Right side shows a smooth, clean orange line representing filtered output with label 'Kalman Filtered (Smooth)'. In the middle, show a filter funnel or processing box with mathematical symbols (sigma, matrices). Include small graphs below showing: 'Velocity' (first derivative), 'Acceleration' (second derivative). Use gradient background from dark blue (#1E3A8A) to slate (#334155). Add subtle grid lines. Include formula hint: 'x(k) = F*x(k-1) + B*u(k) + w(k)'. Modern data visualization style.",
